<!-- Instructions
- The data.js file contains a global array that contains information on different pokemon types
- Inside index.js, you should loop through this array and render a "card" for each pokemon type. Use the example image as
a reference.
- You will also find an HTML example commented out in the index.html
Use the exact CSS classes you see in the example HTML to obtain the same style for each card
- The cards should be nested inside <ul class="cards"></ul>
- Use the official-artwork object key as the images for the card. The images are all inside of the sprites key, in each
pokemon object
- Render all the cards on the page that represents all the pokemons, recreating the same layout, using JS -->

<!-- Extended Requirements
- Add an extra section to each card that contains information about which games each pokemon appeared in.
- See if you can find a way to toggle between the different images of each card! (this is a hard one! You might want to
use google...) -->

<!-- ## Tips
- **Start with a single card**. Once you've got a card, think of a way to programmatically create all the others.
- If you are struggling to create the full card layout - start simple. Try render just the name of each pokemon in a `
<p>` tag. Then, add the image, then the stats, etc
  - Use functions to your advantage. Break each card into smaller parts, and think how you can turn them into functions.
  - Make sure you understand well the data structure before starting to create the cards -->
